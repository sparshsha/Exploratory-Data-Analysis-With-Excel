# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic Dataset

# Overview

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Microsoft Excel. The analysis is divided into different parts, each focusing on various visualization techniques to gain insights from the data.

#File Contents

The Excel file consists of seven sheets, each representing a different stage of analysis:

# 1. TitanicData

Contains the raw Titanic dataset.

May include basic data cleaning steps such as handling missing values and data formatting.

# 2. Part 2

Likely includes summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.

Basic exploratory data insights and key observations.

# 3. Part 3 - Histograms

Visual representation of numerical data distributions.

Helps understand the frequency of different values in key numerical features (e.g., Age, Fare, etc.).

# 4. Part 4 - Box Plots

Box plots help analyze the spread and outliers in numerical variables.

Useful for identifying skewness and detecting extreme values in the dataset.

# 5. Part 5 - Bar Charts

Bar charts visualize categorical variables such as Passenger Class, Gender, and Embarkation Port.

Helps identify dominant categories and distributions.

# 6. Part 6 - Scatter Plots

Scatter plots analyze relationships between two numerical variables.

Useful for detecting correlations and patterns in data (e.g., Age vs. Fare, SibSp vs. Parch).

# 7. Part 7 - Treemap Charts

Treemap charts visualize hierarchical data.

Likely used to showcase categorical variables with nested subcategories.

# Conclusion

This Excel-based EDA provides comprehensive insights into the Titanic dataset using various visualization techniques. Each sheet contributes to understanding data distributions, relationships, and categorical patterns. Further analysis can be extended by applying statistical tests or machine learning models based on these findings.
